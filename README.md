Welcome to my web-based non-custodial wallet called DecentralVault, inspired by the design philosophy of the now-defunct peer-to-peer crypto exchange, Localcryptos!

Despite the unfortunate closure of Localcryptos, I have drawn inspiration from their innovative approach to building secure and user-friendly interfaces for cryptocurrency management.
